## 1. Gabor Patch Training

### Scientific Basis

**Gabor patches** are sinusoidal gratings modulated by a Gaussian envelope. They are fundamental stimuli in vision science because they closely match the receptive field profiles of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1).

### Key Mechanisms

- **Perceptual Learning**: Repeated exposure to Gabor stimuli induces long-term changes in visual cortical processing
- **Neuroplasticity**: Training can strengthen neural connections and improve signal-to-noise ratios in visual pathways
- **Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF)**: Gabor training specifically targets mid-to-high spatial frequencies

### Clinical Applications

- **Amblyopia ("Lazy Eye")**: Multiple studies show 1-2 lines of visual acuity improvement
- **Presbyopia**: Near vision improvements in middle-aged adults
- **Low Vision Rehabilitation**: Post-stroke and macular degeneration patients

## 2. Multiple Object Tracking (MOT)

### Scientific Basis

**Multiple Object Tracking** is a paradigm that tests the ability to simultaneously track several moving objects among identical distractors. It probes the capacity of **dynamic visual attention** and **working memory**.

### Key Mechanisms

- **Selective Attention**: MOT training improves the ability to filter relevant from irrelevant visual information
- **Attentional Resources**: Expands the "spotlight" of attention to cover multiple foci
- **Motion Processing**: Enhances dorsal stream (V5/MT) processing for motion detection
- **Anticipatory Tracking**: Develops predictive models of object trajectories

### Cognitive Benefits

- Enhanced situational awareness
- Improved sports performance (demonstrated in athletes)
- Better driving safety and hazard detection
- Transfer to real-world dynamic tasks

## 3. Vernier Acuity Training

### Scientific Basis

**Vernier acuity** (also called hyperacuity) is the ability to detect minute misalignments between line segments. It represents one of the finest spatial discriminations the visual system can perform.

## 4. Crowding Reduction Training

### Scientific Basis

**Visual crowding** is the deleterious effect of clutter on target identification, particularly in peripheral vision. It's the primary limitation on object recognition outside the fovea.

### Key Mechanisms

- **Bouma's Law**: Crowding occurs when flankers are within 0.5× eccentricity
- **Feature Integration**: Impaired binding of features in clutter
- **Attention Window**: Crowding reflects spatial attention resolution
- **Cortical Pooling**: Excessive integration in peripheral visual areas

### Clinical Applications

- **Amblyopia**: More severe crowding in amblyopic eyes
- **Dyslexia**: Reading difficulties linked to crowding
- **Macular Degeneration**: Critical for eccentric viewing rehabilitation
- **Peripheral Vision**: Training can reduce crowding zones
