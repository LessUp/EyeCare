## 1. Gabor Patch Training

### Scientific Basis

**Gabor patches** are sinusoidal gratings modulated by a Gaussian envelope. They are fundamental stimuli in vision science because they closely match the receptive field profiles of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1).

### Key Mechanisms

- **Perceptual Learning**: Repeated exposure to Gabor stimuli induces long-term changes in visual cortical processing
- **Neuroplasticity**: Training can strengthen neural connections and improve signal-to-noise ratios in visual pathways
- **Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF)**: Gabor training specifically targets mid-to-high spatial frequencies

### Clinical Applications

- **Amblyopia ("Lazy Eye")**: Multiple studies show 1-2 lines of visual acuity improvement
- **Presbyopia**: Near vision improvements in middle-aged adults
- **Low Vision Rehabilitation**: Post-stroke and macular degeneration patients
